By definition, the Space complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount 
of space or memory taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. 
While Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to 
run as a function of the length of the input. Now that we know why Time complexity is so significant, 
it is time to understand what is time complexity and how to evaluate it.
