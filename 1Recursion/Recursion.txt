--What is recursion ?
-->Recursion is a way of solving a problem by having a function calling itself.
*********Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
*********In every step we try smaller input to make the problem smaller.
*********Base condition is needed to stop the recursion, otherwise infinite loop will occur.
